# Welcome to the SeaCO<sub>2</sub> group wiki

## Getting around

The menu on the **left** takes you to different pages.  The menu on the **right** is for navigating within the current page.  There's a search bar at the **top**.

## How to update this wiki

This wiki is built with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and hosted on GitHub Pages from the repo [seaco2/seaco2.github.io](https://github.com/seaco2/seaco2.github.io).  The wiki is automatically updated whenever you push to the `main` branch of the repo.  The content is formatted with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

### File structure

The files that generate the pages of the documentation all have the `.md` extension and are found in the `docs` folder:

    seaco2.github.io/
      mkdocs.yml
      docs/
        index.md  # this home page

The titles of the different pages and the left navigation menu layout are controlled by the `nav` section in the `mkdocs.yml` file.
